# chapter-8-example-3

Code for example 3 from Chapter 8 of [Bootstrapping Microservices](https://www.bootstrapping-microservices.com).

In chapter 8 we create a continuous delivery pipeline for microservices and infrastructure using GitHub Actions.

This example contains an automated continous delivery pipeline that builds and deploys the microservice to Kubernetes when code is pushed to the repository.
